# when running this code.  To do so, your current working directory
# should be the top-level directory (i.e. /workspace/your-app/) and then run:
# rails runner labs/2-models.rb

# Lab 2: Models
# - We've added data into the companies table.  Next, we'll add data
#   into the salespeople table.  Follow the steps below to insert and
#   read rows of salesperson data.  Update a row.  Afterwards, display
#   how many rows have been inserted into the salespeople table.
#   Lastly, if you want a challenge, try writing code to display the
#   full name of each salesperson.

# 1a. check out the schema file
# 1b. check out the model file

# 2. insert 1-2 rows in salespeople table.
